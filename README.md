# Manhattan-Bridge-Bike-Analysis
The analysis aims to describe how weather conditions and day of the week impact the number of bicycles crossing Manhattan Bridge in NYC on a given day using Poisson regression models. The analysis concludes that precipitation and high temperature are the two biggest factors impacting the number of bikes crossing Manhattan bridge on a given day: As precipitation goes up, the number of bikes goes down, and as high temperature increases, the number of bikes also increases. The most significant interaction observed is between day of the week and high temperature.
